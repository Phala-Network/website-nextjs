## RAW IDEA

## Brand & POV

* Voice: crisp, technical, confident; **zero-trust computing**, **TEE/TDX/SEV**, **remote attestation**, **compute-to-data**, **verifiable AI**; avoid hype. Prefer standard cryptographic/security terms the web3/infra audience already knows.
* Audiences: (1) Enterprise buyers (risk/compliance, CIO/CTO, data/AI leaders) and (2) Developer operators (MLOps, agents, LLM infra).
* Promise: **Confidential AI** across data, training, fine-tuning, inference, and agents on a decentralized, attestable compute network.

## Phala primitives (reference in copy)

* Trusted Execution Environments (Intel TDX/SGX-class, AMD SEV), remote attestation, sealed storage, key broker.
* Confidential containers & GPUs; compute-to-data; verifiable execution receipts.
* “Powered by Phala”: decentralized operator network; zero-trust between data owners, model owners, and infra.

## Page briefs & starter copy (fill into the `content.ts` exports)

### 1) Private AI Data

**SEO**

* Title: Private AI Data: Compute-to-Data on Phala
* Description: Monetize and analyze sensitive data with TEEs and remote attestation—without exposing the raw data.

**Hero**

* H1: Unlock sensitive data—without sharing it
* Subhead: Confidential compute turns siloed and regulated datasets into insight, safely. Combine data sources via compute-to-data and verifiable enclaves.
* Primary CTA: Talk to Us | Secondary: Deploy on Phala

**Why it matters**

* Data sharing is blocked by privacy, IP, and regulation; centralized AI leaks control. Phala keeps raw data sealed while models “go to the data”.

**How it works (steps)**

1. **Provision attested enclave** (TEE with measurement & policy).
2. **Bring keys & datasets** via sealed I/O; owners keep custody.
3. **Run jobs compute-to-data** (RAG, analytics, training) inside enclave.
4. **Emit proofs** (attestation receipt, logs) — share results, not data.
5. **Rotate/retire** with audit trails.

**Use cases (cards)**

* **Data Marketplace:** Multi-party joins with revocable policies; revenue share without raw data exchange.
* **Sensitive Data Analytics:** PII/financial/medical analysis with built-in confidentiality.
* **Private RAG:** Retrieve from private corp wikis, CRM, and docs inside enclaves.

**Success stories (logos + 1-liners)**

* **Vana:** User-owned data pools & collective model training via confidential compute.
* **Rena Labs:** Neutral TEE “data rooms” for multi-party analytics/training.
* **Blue Nexus:** Backing privacy-first AI marketplaces on Phala.
* **Xtrace:** Crypto-verified private RAG across agent memory.

**Dev experience**

* Terraform stack, CLI, signed enclave images, KMS integration. Snippets: `phala run --enclave --attest --policy policy.json`.

**Proof & compliance**

* Remote attestation receipts; encryption in-use; policy-guarded outputs; audit logs.

**FAQs** (examples)

* What prevents operators from seeing data?
* How do we verify the enclave code?
* How does key management work across parties?

---

### 2) Private AI Inference

**SEO**

* Title: Private AI Inference: Confidential LLM Serving
* Description: Keep prompts, outputs, and model weights private with GPU TEEs and verifiable attestation.

**Hero**

* H1: Serve models without exposing prompts
* Subhead: Inputs, outputs, and weights stay inside attested GPU enclaves. Privacy as a human right—by design.
* CTAs: Talk to Us / Deploy on Phala

**Why it matters**

* Centralized inference can log prompts and leak IP. Phala enclaves ensure no operator—cloud or vendor—can peek.

**How it works**

1. Package model as confidential container.
2. Attest on deploy; publish measurement.
3. Route requests via mTLS into enclave.
4. Emit usage receipts; never store plaintext.

**Use cases**

* **Privacy as a Human Right:** Zero-logging assistants for consumers & NGOs.
* **Healthcare:** Protected PHI inference; clinic-side deployments.
* **Legal:** Privileged document Q&A and drafting with strict confidentiality.

**Success stories**

* **OODA AI:** Decentralized GPUs with Phala-grade privacy guarantees.
* **NEAR AI:** Private ML SDK—verifiable agent inference.
* **OpenRouter:** Confidential route for enterprise prompts.

**Dev experience**

* OpenAI-compatible API endpoint examples; rate-limit, per-tenant keys; attestation check snippet.

**Proof & compliance**

* Attestation + audit bundles satisfying SOC2/GDPR/HIPAA workflows.

**FAQs**

* Latency/throughput overhead?
* How are logs handled?
* Can we pin model versions to measurements?

---

### 3) Fine-Tuned

**SEO**

* Title: Fine-Tuned Models: Private Customization
* Description: Fine-tune foundation models on proprietary data inside TEEs. Better accuracy, zero data leakage.

**Hero**

* H1: Your model, your data—kept private
* Subhead: Fine-tune LLMs and multimodal models on confidential datasets within attested enclaves.

**Why it matters**

* Custom performance demands private corp data; Phala lets you use it safely.

**How it works**

1. Mount private corpus via sealed storage.
2. Run supervised/LoRA/PEFT inside enclave.
3. Export signed artifacts; restrict egress.
4. Serve in the same enclave family.

**Use cases**

* **AI SaaS** per-tenant models.
* **AI SDR** trained on past threads/CRM.
* **AI Support** tuned on tickets & KB.
* **AI Hiring** with sensitive HR data.
* **AI Marketing** on brand voice & results.

**Dev experience**

* Hugging Face, PyTorch stack; example `trainer` config; confidential checkpoints.

**Proof & compliance**

* Training attestations; dataset access proofs; reproducible build IDs.

**FAQs**

* Can vendors see our data or weights?
* How do we prevent gradient leakage?
* Multi-GPU fine-tune support?

### 4) Training

**SEO**

* Title: Confidential Model Training at Scale
* Description: Distributed pre-training and instruction-tuning on sensitive data with confidential GPUs and attestation.

**Hero**

* H1: Train big, train private
* Subhead: Multi-GPU clusters with verifiable isolation for pre-training and large-scale jobs.

**Concept introduction**

* Why confidential training matters (IP, regulated data, consortium learning).

**How it works**

* Confidential scheduler, GPU enclaves, high-speed interconnect, sealed checkpoints, reproducibility & audit.

**Dev experience**

* Slurm/Kubernetes templates; Terraform modules; example topology; monitoring with enclave-safe telemetry.

**Proof & compliance**

* Signed lineage (data, code hash, environment) for auditors and partners.

**FAQs**

* Cost/perf tradeoffs; distributed training patterns; dataset residency.

---

### 5) AI Agent

**SEO**

* Title: Verifiable AI Agents on Phala
* Description: Autonomous, financial, ambient, and personal agents with enclave execution and on-chain attestations.

**Hero**

* H1: Agents people can trust
* Subhead: Run agent code, memory, and keys inside TEEs. Export verifiable attestations and policies.

**Use cases**

* **Autonomous Agents:** Immutable behavior, no hidden backdoors.
* **Financial Agents:** Hold keys; execute strategies with hardware-grade isolation.
* **Ambient Agents:** Private sensor/voice streams; edge or cloud.
* **Personal Agents:** User-owned data vaults, private by default.
* **Verifiable Agents:** ERC-8004-style identities and receipts.

**Success stories**

* **ElizaOS, Rabbi Agent, Crossmint, Vijil Agent, ERC-8004** ecosystem momentum.

**How it works**

* Identity binding ↔ attestation; policy engine; receipt posting; optional on-chain proofs.

**Dev experience**

* Agent framework adapters; example “sign & prove” flow; allowance-based key operations.

**Proof & compliance**

* Attested identities, action logs, red-teamable without data escape.

**FAQs**

* Can operators change agent code?
* How are secrets managed?
* How to verify the agent you interact with?
