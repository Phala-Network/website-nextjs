    question: 'How does Confidential AI ensure my data is truly private?',
    answer:
      'We use Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) that create cryptographically secure enclaves. Your data is encrypted and processed inside these hardware-protected environments where even we cannot access it. Each computation generates a cryptographic proof that you can verify independently.',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-2',
    question: 'Is there any performance impact compared to regular AI APIs?',
    answer:
      'Minimal performance impact. Our confidential computing infrastructure is optimized for speed while maintaining the highest security standards.',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-3',
    question:
      'How difficult is it to integrate Confidential AI into my existing application?',
    answer:
      'Very easy! Simply replace your API endpoint. Zero code changes required. Works with existing SDKs and frameworks.',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-4',
    question: 'What models are available through Confidential AI?',
    answer:
      'We support all major AI providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Google, Mistral, and Alibaba models.',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-5',
    question: 'How can I verify that my data was actually protected?',
    answer:
      'Every request generates cryptographic proof that you can verify independently. Our Trust Center provides real-time proof generation and audit-ready documentation.',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-6',
    question: 'What are the pricing differences compared to standard AI APIs?',
    answer:
      'Our pricing matches leading inference providers. Privacy protection comes at no additional cost - we believe security should be accessible to everyone, not a premium feature.',
