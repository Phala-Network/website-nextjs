                question: 'How does Phala ensure truly private inference?',
                answer:
                  'Phala uses GPU Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) with Intel TDX and AMD SEV to encrypt all prompts, outputs, and model weights during inference. Not even cloud providers or system administrators can access data in use—only the attested enclave can decrypt your inputs.',

                question:
                  'Can cloud providers or Phala operators see my prompts?',
                answer:
                  'No. Hardware-level memory encryption (Intel TDX/AMD SEV) prevents any operator—including Phala, cloud providers, or root users—from reading runtime memory. Data is encrypted from the moment it enters the TEE until it leaves.',
              },
              {
                question: 'How are GPU model weights protected?',
                answer:
                  'Model weights are loaded directly into encrypted GPU memory inside TEEs. They never touch disk or CPU in plaintext. Each deployment is sealed with cryptographic measurements (mrenclave) you can verify before sending data.',
              },

                question:
                  'What are attestation proofs, and how do I verify them?',
                answer:
                  'Attestation proofs are cryptographic signatures from the CPU/GPU proving the exact code and environment running inside the TEE. Verify them via /v1/attestation endpoints before sending prompts—ensuring no tampering or backdoors exist.',

                  'How long does it take to deploy a private inference endpoint?',
                answer:
                  "Under 5 minutes. Use Docker containers with pre-configured TEE images, or deploy via Phala Cloud's one-click interface. No custom firmware or low-level TEE programming required.",

              {
                question: "What's the latency overhead of TEE inference?",

                  '5-15% compared to bare-metal GPUs. Memory encryption happens at hardware speed with Intel TDX/AMD SEV, so most workloads see negligible impact. Batching and caching reduce overhead further.',
